v0.2.2
- Added ability to pick multiple intermediate targets
- Removed latitude and longitude
- Removed max landing thrust angle, it is set to 25% of max thrust angle
- Removed acceleration gain, it is set to 4x correction factor
- Removed idle angle, it is now always 90 degrees
- Removed max thrust, this is set to 10% less than the vessels maximum
- Max thrust angle in the solution is 20% less than max thrust angle
- Min descent angle only applies to the final trajectory before the final target and not to intermediate targets
- Ground intersect constraint always applies where the ground is the lowest of all the ground targets
- The solution velocity isn't modified by the PID, which results in better following of the trajectory
- Can enable guidance from a landed vessel if there are intermediate targets
- Switch to using mesh rather than LineRenderer for track and thrust vectors to attempt to removing disappearing track bug. This still happens though, but a mesh should be much more efficient

v0.2.1
- Added TestCraft and TestCraftHeavy
- Tested with KSP version 1.8.1 up to 1.10.0
- Can enable/disable logging to vessel.dat and solution.dat
- Can show/hide the track, alignment vector, and thrust vectors
- Works with Realism Overhaul but trajectories look shaky
