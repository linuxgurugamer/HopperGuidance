- Show path travelled by vessel? (when logging?)
- Get a working Visual Studio Project file
- Make target always show above ground. Especially random on RO
  is this because CoG moves up because fuel is used up? could well be.
- Add finalDescentHeight to interface?
- Trouble touching down
- Difficult to fly from ground upwards and descent mode is activated (use next target is below?)

Thinking of the interface to this mod from another mod. Want
- make sure target is always visible (especially bad in RO?)
- how to set parameters of trajectory???
- CalcTrack(targets)
- ShowTrack(bool)
- ShowSteer(bool)
- ShowTargets(bool)
- ShowThrustVectors(bool)
- Enable/cancel guidance
- To be able to clear targets, set targets to lat, long, height above ground
- To be able to enable/cancel guidance
- To monitor guidance. Report position, velocity and attitude error for logging
- To be able to show/hide track
