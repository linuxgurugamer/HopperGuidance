- Show path travelled by vessel
- Get a working Visual Studio Project file
- Get align vector in the right place again
- More accurate computation of trajectory
- Add License.txt and Changelog.txt to installed mod
- Better solution for intermediate targets (i.e. hopHeight)
- Fly craft relative to another craft, say in orbit? Basically autodock, but MJ does this
- Problem with final landing. Not corrected trajectory for final position?
- Correct final not working on multi-part trajectories (or drawn position is wrong)
- Make trajectory computation work when on ground. Looks to be related to very short T solution with too many checks, T<firstGapTime ?
- In multi-part trajectory reuse previous results for extra speed
- Better solution to final landing now minDescentAngle doesn't work for low trajectories
