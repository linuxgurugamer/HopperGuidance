- Show path travelled by vessel
- Get a working Visual Studio Project file
- Get align vector in the right place again
- Check speed, minDescentAngle check so more around start and finish to cope better when outside of constraints at start
- More accurate computation of trajectory
- Don't leave targets lying around
- Add License.txt and Changelog.txt to installed mod
- Better solution for intermediate targets (i.e. hopHeight)

Handling additional targets
- select like pickTarget
- Need to be able to cancel target
- Need to be able to set speed? (not for first version - might not have position even)
- Setting order of targets is tricky. Specify them in order
- Click on target to select then click elsewhere to move
- Need to be able to adjust height of target when ground position specified
- Compute trajectory without flying it? Nice to have. Perhaps show track will mean trajectory is automatically recomputed and then shown
