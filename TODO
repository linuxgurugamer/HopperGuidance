- Show path travelled by vessel?
- Get a working Visual Studio Project file
- Get align vector in the right place again (use _wtraj?)
- Add License.txt and Changelog.txt to installed mod
- Better solution for intermediate targets (i.e. hopHeight)
- Fly craft relative to another craft, say in orbit? Basically autodock, but MJ does this
- In multi-part trajectory reuse previous results for extra speed
